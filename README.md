## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of Flexbox and Media Queries. I also gained experience in creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. Below is a sample of the code that I found particularly challenging but ultimately rewarding:

```html
<h1>FAQs</h1>
```

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-image: url('../images/background-pattern-desktop.svg');
  background-size: 100% auto;
  background-position: top center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: hsl(275, 100%, 97%);
  font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. In future projects, I aim to incorporate more advanced CSS techniques and explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand the nuances of Flexbox and how to apply it effectively in my project.
- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This resource provided a comprehensive overview of media queries and how to use them for responsive design.
